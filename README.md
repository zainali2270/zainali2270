I am Zain, a senior full-stack web developer with 4 years of experience. I can design and develop a new website or make changes to an existing one. I have also been working on web development since the age of 15.
I am a student at University of Central Punajb (UCP) and I am currently taking course in Computer Science (2020 - 2024).
I create websites and web applications for a living, so as you can imagine I'm always looking for new ways to diversify my skills set.
I develop a range of services and solutions for many organizations, from startups to Fortune 500 companies. I have a passion for efficiency and simplicity in my work, with a focus on clean code and scalability.
